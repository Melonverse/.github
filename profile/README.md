# Super League
Welcome to the Super League Enterprise! A fully remote company building metaverse experiences.

## Templates
We've been hard at work to setup a couple templates for our experiences. These templates utilize our standard in house tools such as [Replicator](https://github.com/RemnantsOfSiren/Replicator) and [Cardinal](https://github.com/RemnantsOfSiren/Cardinal).

* Experience Template
This template is for use whenever you're setting up a standard non-popup experience.

* PopUp Template
This template is for use whenever you're setting up a standard pop-up.

## Libraries
On top of working on standard templates and project structure, we've also been cranking away on in house libraries. You can use these in combination with a template to substantially lower development time and quickly ramp up a prototype!

Libraries can be found in our [Libraries](https://github.com/Melonverse/Libraries) repository. Each library comes with a README and documentation then on top of that, the Libraries Repository itself has a README as well.
